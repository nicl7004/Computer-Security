1. {Stadium} Scenario

Assets:
- Infrastructure - We want the stadium to be in good shape for the players and fans
- Players - If something happens to the players (outside of the game) we will loose revenue.
- Fans - Without the fans we wouldn't have the need for a stadium.

Threats:
- Stadium Bombing - It is possible that an adversary wish to harm the fans and players of the stadium through use of explosives.
- Crowd rushing the field - After a high-stakes game the crowd may rush the field and harm the players or each other in the process.
- Graffiti and destruction of stadium property - It is possible that an adversary wish to leave a mark on the stadium through graffiti or other means.

Countermeasures:
- Increase the screening at the gate of the stadium - With increased screening will come inconvenience and the prices of hiring workers
as well as purchasing the machines required to preform the screening.  With this comes more confidence that no malicious items can enter the
stadium in the hands of an adversary.  This could provide a solution to threats 1 and 3.
- Increase security near the end of the game - Spread several security personnel around the edge of the field near the end of the game to discourage
rushing of the field.  This will again cost more money to employ the security personnel.
- Increase security cameras - Install high res cameras around the stadium, will discourage adversaries from preforming destruction of property and other malicious acts.
This will cost money for hardware, but might be less expensive than hiring more personnel.
